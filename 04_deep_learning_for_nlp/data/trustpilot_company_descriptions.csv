Animals & Pets,naturaldoggytreats.com,"Hey there fellow dog lovers! Let me tell you the tail (pun intended) of how our brand came to be.

It all started 3 years ago when my furry best friend Dudley had a bad reaction to a bag of shop bought treats from a well-known supermarket chain. Little did we know that the treats were chock-full of hidden nasties such as cereals, corn, sugar, derivatives, preservatives, and flavourings. It didn't take long for Dudley to develop a runny bum and a bad tummy - talk about a total paw-saster!

We rushed Dudley to our local vet who ran a few tests and discovered that he was allergic to wheat. After a lot of research, countless emails, and car miles, we finally stumbled upon a handful of fantastic natural treat suppliers who we now partner with to bring you the best of the best natural dog treats today.

But we didn't stop there. We realised that there were so many dog owners out there who were also struggling to find healthy, safe and delicious treats for their fur babies. That's when we decided to create a community of like-minded dog owners who share our passion for all things natural, nutritious and delicious.

So, we started a private customer Facebook group where dog owners could come together, interact, and share their stories, tips, and tricks. We wanted to create a space where people could feel supported, educated and empowered to make the best choices for their dogs.

And that's exactly what we did! Our community has grown into a tight-knit group of dog moms and dads who are passionate about giving their furry family members the very best. We've become a go-to resource for dog owners looking to go raw hide-free, learn more about the benefits of natural dog treats, and connect with other dog lovers who share their values.

So, whether you're a seasoned dog mom/dad or a brand new puppy parent, we're here for you. We're excited to be a part of your dog's journey and can't wait to see what the future holds. Thanks for being a part of our pack! üê∂üíõ"

Animals & Pets,floppyear.co.uk,"We offer 100% natural dog chews & treats!

We are careful and very conscious when it comes to sourcing our products.

Our dogs are part of our family. We know they deserve nothing less than the best. But in reality, most dog chews and treats have big marketing budgets but inferior quality. Also, most dog chews & treats advertise as ""natural"", but they come from Asia with uncertain, unknown and often harmful ingredients, produced under poor environmental and labour standards and cost a lot. Commercially available chews left a lot to desire. Eventually, after much trial and error, we realised that fresh and natural treats worked best for dogs.
We don't like eating junk food, so why should things be different for our four-legged family members? Our chews & treats are suitable for dogs with sensitive tummies. Many commercial dog chews & treats do not suit many dogs, so we researched the different types of chews and treats. Our sourcing products are either UK or EU-produced. We visit our suppliers and talk to them regularly to ensure that our products are 100% natural, with no added additives, chemicals, or flavourings. Also, these companies follow EU laws regarding animal welfare.
Today, we are proud to offer an exciting line of dog chews and treats made from a single or limited ingredient, 100% natural and as nutritious as delicious. 100% satisfaction guaranteed.

Let your Dog be a Dog. Unlock his natural instincts the healthy way!

Beauty & Well-being,cbdasylum.com,"From a pie-in-the-sky concept by two lads in Hull 5 years ago, to the most trusted CBD company in the UK, it‚Äôs safe to say CBD Asylum hasn‚Äôt spent a minute stood still.

Not ones to do anything by half, back in 2017 we did it the hard way- we learnt how to produce all our own products in our ISO level 7 cleanrooms rather than buying them in from another company, as many other CBD 'manufacturers‚Äô do. After a short while we saw our opening, and realised people want variety, they want flavour, they want great quality and even better value and most of all they want the sort of customer service you‚Äôd expect at Buckingham Palace!

Off the back of this, in March 2018, CBD Asylum was born- the tastiest, friendliest, cheapest, best quality, and now the most trusted CBD outfit ever to grace the CBD industry!!

At CBD Asylum, our customer service guys Tony and Kat simply cannot do enough for you- whether it‚Äôs an order query or just some friendly advice- they‚Äôre always in the shop or at the end of the phone.

What about every company saying they have great deals? Well with our frankly ridiculous offers like ‚ÄòBuy One Get Two Free‚Äô, nobody can beat us on value.

Surely our quality is lower than other brands because we‚Äôre so much cheaper? No way, Jose! All our products are third-party tested and everything is manufactured in-house in our lab to ensure absolute quality from plant to bottle! Nothing is bought from other manufacturers, this is how we keep the prices low and the quality high.

‚ÄúBut every company says they‚Äôre the best in the industry‚Äù I hear you say. True, but we can prove it! We‚Äôre the top rated CBD company on the worlds leading consumer review site- Trustpilot!

So check out the largest, most flamboyant, most colourful, tastiest, cheapest and best quality variety of CBD products that anyone has to offer.

Ladies and gentlemen, this is CBD Asylum!"

Sports,canterbury.com,"Canterbury of New Zealand was established back in 1904 when John Lane, Pringle Walker and Alfred Rudkin began producing woollen garments deep in the Canterbury Province of New Zealand.  Before long, they were making uniforms for the army during the First World War, and they earned themselves a reputation for manufacturing tough, durable kit.  So much so, the legendary All Blacks rugby team approached them to produce rugby attire in which they could play.

The rest as they say is history; Canterbury of New Zealand outfitted the All Blacks team for over 75 years and is now the largest dedicated rugby brand in the world.  Canterbury currently supplies kit to numerous high-profile national rugby teams; England Rugby and Ireland Rugby, as well as leading clubs such as Bath and Ospreys.  

The brand has its roots firmly in the southern hemisphere with its spiritual home in New Zealand. The Kiwi heritage strongly influences both the design of Canterbury product and the ethos of the company."

The award-winning Heatrub Ultimate baselayer was unveiled to the Japanese public in 2011 and since then hundreds of thousands of outdoor enthusiasts have discovered the benefits of that best-in-class product. Independently tested and proven to be five times warmer than a standard baselayer, the Heatrub Ultimate has become a must-have item in the coldest months of the year and, such was the popularity of the baselayer, Zerofit now offer leggings and socks made from the same material.
Other key products include the Heatrub Move baselayer, which features Adaptable Warmth Technology, keeping you warm while at a standstill but also temperature regulation when you‚Äôre working up a sweat. For the summer months, the Cold Skin baselayer is three times colder than a competitor product, while the Ice Weave is the master when it comes to wicking excess sweat in the hottest conditions.
Following exponential growth across industries including motorcycling, angling, running, hiking, sailing, golf, gardening, birdwatching and equestrian sports, Zerofit welcomed a new shareholder and ambassador in February 2023 - Brian O'Driscoll, the former Leinster, Ireland and British & Irish Lions rugby captain in order to help further enhance the business across multiple categories. And since November 2023, Bennetts British Superbikes Runner-Up Glenn Irwin has joined the brand as an ambassador. He will rely on Zerofit baselayers while racing during the 2024 season. 
The European HQ of Zerofit is in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, with further offices in Adelaide, Australia and San Diego in the US. Specialist customer service teams in each country ensure prompt and accurate delivery of products as the brand continues to grow globally.
Whatever your sport or activity, we hope Zerofit will become your baselayer brand of choice.

40 day battery life.
Because is there anything more depressing than having to use an electric toothbrush, manually?

Best Case Scenario.
Perfectly portable, every SURI sustainable sonic toothbrush also comes with a UV-C Self-Cleaning Travel Case that let's you charge your toothbrush and uses UV-C light to keep your bristles bacteria-free on the go.

Each toothbrush comes with a minimalist magnetic mirror mount to free up space on your bathroom counter.

Pharmadoctor is a leading UK provider of private clinical services for patients through its nationwide network of 8,000 partner pharmacies and clinics. 
Patients can conveniently access over 60 clinical services and 200+ prescription-only treatments without the wait for a GP appointment.

Private Flu Vaccination

Full Vaccination Services
Pharmadoctor has the UK's largest network of travel clinics and its thousands of partner pharmacies also offer a variety of clinical services.  Services include the full range of vaccinations such as chickenpox vaccines and private Covid vaccines, as well as weight management clinics. All services provided are private so are not limited by NHS restrictions. With Pharmadoctor you can book a private Covid vaccination appointment for your entire family even if they are not eligible for a Covid jab on the NHS. Pharmadoctor partner pharmacies and clinics can also offer services on a walk-in basis, perfect for those looking for last minute travel vaccines and treatments as well as comprehensive travel health advice.  All patients have access to their full consultation history within their Pharmadoctor account and can see records of any vaccinations given, as well as summaries of travel advice provided during consultations. The weight management service consists of face-to-face consultations where thorough assessments can be carried out, complete with goal setting, progress reviews and, if clinically appropriate, access to all the latest weight loss medication including weight loss jabs; all designed to help ensure healthier and sustainable weight loss.



How it works? 
Visit www.pharmadoctor.co.uk/patient, select the clinic / service you are interested in, search for your nearest Pharmadoctor partner pharmacy offering the service, then simply book an appointment online. 

You can even complete a pre-consultation online before your appointment to speed up the process. Alternatively, just walk into one of our participating pharmacies and see a trusted local pharmacist who can provide you with a consultation and treatment if appropriate. 



Why Pharmadoctor?
Our multi-award-winning pharmacy services have helped over 1 million patients, blending the best of digital health with local bricks and mortar pharmacies.
Unlike digital-only clinical services, Pharmadoctor connects patients directly with a real healthcare professional (your trusted local pharmacist) at every consultation. The result is a convenient, accessible and affordable private healthcare service when you need it most.
If you are travelling abroad and need vaccinations or you are looking for help with weight management, your local GP service may not be able to provide a convenient and timely solution. Pharmadoctor has identified the key areas where patients are struggling to find the service and treatments they require, at a time that suits them, and is stepping in to help.



Pharmadoctor services for pharmacies
Pharmadoctor has been working hard since 2009 to be the leading provider of clinical services to the UK pharmacy sector. With over 12,000 community pharmacists having used our services from small independent pharmacies to nationwide pharmacy chains we are proud to be delivering valued clinical services that are putting community pharmacy back where it belongs.
Our consultation guidance system, the Pharmadoctor eTool, provides pharmacists with all the support they need to offer a comprehensive service, including up-to-date relevant clinical advice specific to the patient in attendance.

Why does your cat food smell?
About KatKin
KatKin goes hardcore for cat health. For far too long the fat cats of the industry have been pushing false information and fluffy claims about what cats need to eat.
Born To Eat Meat
KatKin is a nutrition, education, and community focused cat-care brand that works with world leading veterinarians and nutritionists to develop fresh food that gives cats the nutrients they actually need. KatKin is cutting the fluff from the cat food industry and exposing the truth behind mass-produced cat food.

Mission
KatKin‚Äôs mission is to show cat ownership for what it actually is, and defy the stereotypes of cat‚Äôs being ‚Äúeasy to care for.‚Äù Cats need ‚Äúhardcore love‚Äù no matter if they‚Äôre a finicky feline or have a tricky tummy. The time for change is now, and KatKin won‚Äôt stop until their cat-first, no-bs attitude becomes the new standard everywhere.

Pets are family and they deserve proper food
But what is proper food?  Proper food means nutritionally complete recipes made by experts, labelled honestly, using ethically sourced natural ingredients. No meat meal, no additives and no cheap fillers. Just fresh meat, delicious veg, and herbs and botanicals that support your dogs‚Äô and cats‚Äô health so they can concentrate on sitting on laps, shoulders and heads, demanding walkies, 6am breakfasts and knocking things over with their tails ‚Äòby accident‚Äô ‚Äì or so they claim.
For people, pets and the planet
We‚Äôre a certified BCorp. That means we believe in using business as a force for good. Here are a few of our guiding values:
Supporting charities
In the last 6 months we‚Äôve donated over 28,000 meals to dog and cat shelters and we‚Äôre not stopping there. We‚Äôre always working on ways we can partner with charities of all sizes to help in any way we can, be it fundraising, donations or rolling up our sleeves and volunteering our own time.
Minimising our pawprint on the planet
From the way we work to improve our packaging (which is nearly all compostable or recyclable) to the cleaning products we choose for our office. Every decision has the planet at it‚Äôs core.
Being a BCorp and staying a BCorp
We are the founding UK BCorporation and every three years we re-certify by evidencing meeting the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose.

Petnap 
Having started in 1973 long before the internet was even thought about, we were the first company in the UK and beyond to offer whelping suppliers to the everyday customer. We have a total of 5 warehouses dotted around the UK (mostly in the south of England) with large stock reserves to meet our customer‚Äôs needs. Our company has become so thought after and popular that others home abroad have imitated many of our products, some even using the same name, be sure to know that there is only one real Petnap.

Petnap Whelping Box
A¬†whelping box, also known as a¬†birthing box,¬†whelping pen¬†and nesting box is used in order to protect the¬†puppies after the whelping process is completed and during the early stages of life when they are most vulnerable. The whelping box keeps them safely contained away from the cold, most whelping boxes also contain rails or poles around the lower edges of which we get asked all the time what these are for and the short answer is they stop the mother crushing the puppies up against the sides of the box which could cause the puppies to become suffocated as well as being crushed.
At petnap we sell 2 types of nesting boxes,¬†Disposable Cardboard¬†and Reusable Plastic¬†whelping boxes.¬†Both of these boxes will cope with the duration of the whelping process normally around 6 to 8 weeks before they then move on to a more suitable environment like a play pen as they become ever more adventurous. We stock 5 sizes in both types giving you plenty of choice as also have heavy duty plastic versions in our large 2 sizes.
Whelping Kit 
Having a whelping kit, prepared in advance can help clear your mind and focus solely on making sure your future pups are as comfortable and as well looked after as possible.
Petnap Whelping Store 
Petnap also see a range of many other products from vet pet fleece bedding, pet heat pads, crates, pens, whelping supplements, heated cat and dog beds the list goes on.

 About Dyson 


Dyson was founded on the idea of solving problems that others ignore; vacuum cleaners that clog and lose suction, hand dryers that are energy hungry and don't work, and hair technology that relies on extreme temperatures and cause heat damage.

Today, Dyson machines are sold in over 65 countries. From  cordless vacuum cleaners  to air purifiers to  hair dryers ; a whole new generation of technology has made its way into the hands of Dyson owners around the world.

It‚Äôs really important that our products help save the bees. did you know one in every three mouthfuls of food we eat relies on plants being pollinated by bees? And over the past few years there has been a global decline in bee populations, including here in the UK.

Well, we‚Äôre determined to do something about it and we need your help!

After 2 years there was sufficient demand to open a small shop on Mary Street, Scunthorpe. Demand soon dictated a move to larger premises and in 1991 we moved to our current premises on Cole Street, Scunthorpe.

Tradewinds Oriental Shop has continued to grow and in 2008 we launched our online website offering consumers within the UK and Europe the opportunity to purchase our products at the click of a button.

Demand for Asian food and drink has continued to grow in popularity over the years which have led to the expansion of our current shop and warehouse premises in recent years.

About COOK
 
COOK was founded in 1997 by Ed and Dale, two big-hearted entrepreneurs. Their founding statement was: to COOK using the same ingredients and techniques a good cook would use at home, so everything looks and tastes homemade. Much has changed since then but that principle remains: we COOK so you don‚Äôt have to.  

  
COOK meals and puddings have picked up scores of Great Taste Awards and are still prepared by hand in our three kitchens. You can find COOK shops on 95 high streets nationwide and our meals are stocked in 900+ independent retailers.

 
Over the years, we‚Äôve set out to become a better kind of company. One that cares as much about doing what‚Äôs right for people and planet as about making a profit. It‚Äôs why we run carbon neutral kitchens and support people into work after prison, homelessness or mental health challenges through our RAW Talent scheme. In 2013 we became one of the UK‚Äôs first B Corps, independently certified as using our business as a force for good.

 Who are we? 
We are Wecasa. We connect customers with vetted professionals through our website and our app. Since the launch in 2016, we do that in a smart and caring way. How, you might ask ?
 
 We develop local businesses 
We have one dream: make at-home services accessible to everyone everywhere.
Whether you are in a city that never sleeps or far out in the countryside
Whether you are looking to get shiny nails or shiny floor
The Wecasa pros are here. 
 We pay professionals a fair wage 
75% of the customer price goes to the pro on average for every order. What about the margin? Do not worry, there isn‚Äôt a big castle in Marbella or sparkling watches. The margin helps us finance the VAT, the logistics costs, the team salaries and the marketing investment to build Wecasa‚Äôs awareness. Furthermore, we are aligned with the London Living Wage.
 Wecasa pros are free to choose when they want to work  
By working with Wecasa, our partners are free to say yes or no to every proposal they receive. They can pick their working hours, their travel area. They are free to develop their customer base without Wecasa or to work with similar app. They are also free to leave the pro community without a reason. 
 Our algorithm rewards every talent ‚Äì no discrimination   
We created an algorithm to match pros with customers. For this, we take into account the travel area and the talent in order to favour the best pro. We do not take into account the gender nor the background. It might not be significant for you, but for us (and for them) this means a lot. An example? 

 We are transparent with our partners    
We communicate to all of our partners how the algorithm works, the score they have and the areas in which they can improve on. We do not point fingers, being transparent is not obvious to all companies.
 We are an international team 
Wecasa is a team of 80 people with 60% of women, 17 nationalities and diverse profiles in terms of age, religion, disability, professional or personal background, sexual orientation. We strive to create a motivating and respectful work environment for everyone.

OUR ADDRESS SERVICE is provided from an address in the heart of London's business and professional services district. We were the first formation agent to offer all our address users a free document scanning service. Furthermore, we are the only address service provider to offer an online document storage system allowing clients to access all the post we have scanned for them as and when they need to. This saves our clients a lot of time searching through their emails to find their post.

Our TRANSPARENT PRICING lets clients predict how much we will charge for ongoing services. 

In addition to company formations, we have developed expertise in two other services, namely;

COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANIES (CIC): We register hundreds of Community Interest Companies every year and have been doing so for many years. We know the registration system inside out and can complete the process quickly and efficiently. Our charges for this service are lower than the fees typically charged by accountants and solicitors. In fact, many of our CIC orders come from professionals.

ADMINISTRATIVE COMPANY RESTORATIONS: We have developed expertise in restoring companies struck off by Companies House. We act quickly and efficiently and keep clients informed at all process stages. Our fees are modest and transparent. We process several hundred restorations annually and frequently do so on behalf of accountants and solicitors.

SOCIAL ENTERPRISES AND CHARITIES: We have several options for companies limited by guarantees. The possibilities range from companies that clubs and associations can use to company structures suitable for future use as charities. We also have a close association with a small accountancy practice that specialises in charity accounting and, because of their experience as trustees to several charities, can advise on the creation of a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO)


NON-UK RESIDENT CLIENTS: Our scanning and document storage and filing system makes our service particularly useful to non-UK resident clients. No charge for getting post; it's all included in the subscription. Consequently, many of our clients are not based in the UK. :

Full Metal Finance (FMF) is an Essex based finance broker with a twist; that we specialise in the construction, landscaping, civils and groundworks industries.


FMF‚Äôs services range from hire purchase to cash flow funding with everything in between. The vast range of services offered were designed with our customers in mind, as we realise that there is no universal finance solution that applies to all situations, so we always provide a highly personalised experience. This ethos has brought us a lot of success, shown by the fact that we are one of the fastest growing independent finance providers in the UK! 


Our team consists of experienced Account Directors, each of whom have a keen interest of the construction, landscaping, civils and groundworks industries and have subsequently accumulated over 30 years of experience combined. This experience is fundamental to the success we have had so far, as we are extremely knowledgeable and passionate about what we do.


Investment costs in new and used equipment can be extremely high, therefore structuring the finance agreement in the right way to minimise impact on cashflow is imperative. FMF treat every business with the same attention to detail, regardless of whether they‚Äôve been around for 10 years or 10 days.

Home & Garden,www.qettle.com,"Brilliant, British-designed and manufactured QETTLE boiling water taps are 4 in 1, and dispense truly boiling, 100¬∞C water - so you can make a proper cuppa! 

Why Choose QETTLE?
Simple and safe to use, easy to install and cost-efficient, it‚Äôs time to say hello to a QETTLE and goodbye to your kettle! And best of all, thanks to its unique, multi-patented design, a QETTLE is affordable, too.
As a family-owned business, we know great products and great people make the difference. We‚Äôve lived and breathed kitchen taps for two generations and our fantastic team of dedicated in-house customer service, design, engineering and manufacturing means our family can be trusted to bring a quality, unique product into yours. 

4 in 1
Always 100¬∞C water, nothing less.
Filtered drinking water (you can add a chiller too).
Normal hot and cold flows.
It‚Äôs that simple.
BUY QETTLE ORIGINAL
Reassuringly Safe
With two-stage safety and an insulated spout, a QETTLE boiling water tap is reassuringly safe. First of all, there‚Äôs the red safety clip. When in place, it makes it impossible for boiling water to be dispensed.
    Highly visual and tactile, it provides peace of mind for children or more vulnerable members of the family.
    There‚Äôs no need to remove the safety clip for filtered drinking water, so the kids can fill up safely and easily. 
Secondly, there‚Äôs a handle lock. The button on the handle must be pressed down at the same time as the handle is turned clockwise.
     So even with the safety clip removed, it‚Äôs a precise and exacting action to get boiling water.
And of course, unlike a kettle, a QETTLE is fixed in once place, can‚Äôt topple over and doesn‚Äôt need to be lifted.

How Many Cups?
QETTLE boiling water taps can be teamed with 2, 4 or 7 litre boiler tanks. Making instant hot drinks is just the beginning, so think about how you'll use your tap before you choose its tank size.
    A 2L tank will give you 4 cups of boiling water in one go, a 4L tank delivers 8 cups and a 7L tank provides 14 cups.
BUY QETTLE SIGNATURE
Installation Your Way
Whether you‚Äôre fitting your QETTLE yourself, engaging a plumber or using a QETTLE Accredited Installer, you can be confident that installing a QETTLE is fuss-free.
If you‚Äôre still doing your homework, a great place to start is our pre-installation checklist,
    which covers everything you need to know from water pressure to working out what will go where under the sink. Our step-by-step installation video is a must-watch.
QETTLE Care
As with any appliance, there is a small amount of care required to keep your cuppas tasting great. 
Filter cartridges must be replaced every six months (we‚Äôll send you reminders) and once a year you‚Äôll need to deep clean your boiler tank.
     This is a very quick job you can safely do yourself,
     all you‚Äôll need is ¬£7.50 for your Kilrock descaler, and 10 minutes to follow our step-by-step video guide at QETTLE.com.

All About Denby 
When you buy Denby, you're choosing items with purpose and soul: hand-crafted, considered and made-to-last pieces that are truly a conscious choice. We‚Äôre still on the same site in Derbyshire where the pottery was founded in 1809 and our rich heritage is built on the generations of craftspeople making pottery here. Nestled next door to the seam of clay which our founder discovered, many traditional hand-crafting techniques are still used in our factory today. Everything we design and craft has versatility, beauty and durability, and is truly styled by life.
Versatile 
One set can be everyday and special occasions, and every piece can be used in the oven, freezer, microwave and dishwasher. Our ranges are super versatile and multi-functional so a smaller number of pieces are needed - cook, serve and store in the same piece.  Mugs double as plant pots, bowls as candle or trinket holders and jugs as vases.
Beautiful 
Our stunning glazes and shapes make Denby a lovely thing to have in your home, share when you‚Äôre entertaining and also to buy as a thoughtful and sustainable gift. Our ceramics and homewares are not just for the kitchen - enjoy them around the home to add style as well as function to any room.
Durable 
Denby‚Äôs durability is legendary, an attribute which becomes increasingly important as we look to reduce our disposable purchases. Our stoneware ranges come with a 10 year guarantee, and as our stoneware is super-strong, you can use it confidently and for occasions when you might otherwise use a disposable plate or cup.

Our history
Our roots lie with the Royal British Legion (RBL), which in 1921 began to house disabled ex-servicemen and widows and, later, older ex-servicemen and women. In 1964, we became a recognised housing association before separating from the Royal British Legion in 1993 to become Housing 21.
Our guiding principles
Our three guiding principles are: 21, Better and Experience. We seek to apply these to all that we do.
21
We are committed to providing a modern, forward-thinking 21st century service. This includes updating and modernising our existing housing, as well as developing new and innovative property designs and service models for the future. We will challenge ourselves to think differently, embracing the disruptive potential of new technologies and the challenges and opportunities of social change.
Better
We strive for continuous improvement and innovation in all that we do. We will never become complacent and will constantly challenge ourselves to do better and achieve better performance, quality and value for money. We aim to be ‚Äòbetter than good‚Äô and work hard to provide excellent services we are proud of and our residents deserve.
Experience
We aim to provide a consistently excellent service and a great experience for all the people we serve. We seek to engage and empower residents to make choices and exercise control over the services they receive and to devolve decision making to local employees who are closest to the residents whenever practicable and possible. We are committed to acting ethically and openly in all that we do, questioning whether we are ‚Äòdoing the right thing‚Äô and being ready to acknowledge and learn from mistakes. Ultimately the success of Housing 21 rests on the satisfaction we provide to our residents.

Money & Insurance,homemadehomes.com,"We are Homemade Homes the experienced property sales team within Accent Housing. Homemade Homes by Accent is a brand name for the sale of homes owned by Accent Housing Limited and Accent Homemade Limited.
We specialise in Shared Ownership, another way to buy your home. You buy a percentage and pay rent on the rest. We own just part of it ‚Äì but you‚Äôre living there, you decorate it and decide when to sell.
Buying a percentage means a smaller deposit and a smaller mortgage. It‚Äôs a sooner first step on the ladder for lots of people. Usually, you can carry on buying further shares to own it 100%.
Buying a share means you need a lower mortgage and deposit than purchasing a property outright. This makes it a cost-effective way to own your own home and ideal for first-time buyers. Shared Ownership usually works out less per month than renting privately.
We want to be ‚Äòwith you for your journey‚Äô, whether that is helping you to take the first step onto the housing ladder or helping you search for a new home, we will be right there with you.

Public & Local Services,rosebudnannyagency.co.uk,"Rosebud Nanny Agency is a multi-award winning nanny agency matching nannies and families in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and South Cambridgeshire. 
Rosebud Nanny Agency is owned and run by Abigail Plested, a former nanny, and has been operating since early 2013. 

Abigail is passionate about children and dedicated to giving them the best start in life. She believes stability in their home life is the best way to achieve this. 
 
At Rosebud Nanny Agency, we strive to match each family with the nanny who best shares their ideas on bringing up their children. We believe consistency is key, and a harmonious relationship between children, parents and their nanny starts with this. 
 
We offer a professional yet personal service to every family, where you as the parent are in control. 
We aim to make the recruitment process stress-free for you ‚Äì we are happy to answer general questions and enquiries, with no obligation. 

Nannies, like childminders and most nursery staff, hold childcare qualifications, paediatric first aid certificates and DBS (formally CRB) checks. They also often hold nanny insurance, although it‚Äôs not a requirement unless they are Ofsted registered (so you can use the tax free childcare scheme, or childcare vouchers towards the nannys cost) 
They are your employee, they come to your house for their working day, and solely care for your child/children. This means you would employ them through PAYE and have a contract of employment (both things I will guide you with!) 
 
Nannies look after all ages of children ‚Äì it depends on your family! If you have a child at home and one at school, you have a complete childcare option rather than using nursery for one child, breakfast and after school club for the other, and muddling through school holidays in any fashion possible. 
 
Nannies working days and hours are set by you as the employer, so are often the most flexible form of childcare. You pay for the hours you need. 
 
 
Rosebud Nanny Agency covers Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Southern Cambridgeshire ‚Äì St Albans, Harpenden, Welwyn Garden City, Hitchin, Watford, Rickmansworth, Berkhamsted, Biggleswade, Cambridge, St Neots, Amersham and many more. Please contact us today to discuss your childcare requirements. "

After a lifetime of working in a career with babies and children I have a wealth of experience to share. An additional 3 years experience working in a special care baby unit with sick and premature babies and 21 years supporting parents overnight as a night nanny. This experience has enabled me to condence my knowledge and share it with parents who may have become parents for the first time.

The advice, support and practical help in most cases takes place in the parents home. If the parents are overseas the help can be shared in an online meeting or phone call.

Advice is very much a personal approach to the individual child and the uniqueness of that family life. Ethnicity and cultural backgrounds are always taken consideration as many families live overseas and parents come from diverse backgrounds.

Above all I respond well to communication and support each family with the same enthusiasm with my job today as I did the first day I became a trained nursery nurse."

 More about our courses and resources 
¬†



We offer a range of solutions for your CPD needs: Online pre-recorded courses, online ‚Äòlive‚Äô training, and in-person courses for teams in your setting or at your conference ‚Äì many of which are award-winning, and all of which regularly receive 5* reviews!
¬†
All of our courses and training come with associated resources which mean you will be able to deliver Pyjama Drama activities to the children in your care with skill and confidence. We have trained professionals at all stages of their career ‚Äì from students at the very start of their journey in education, through to teachers who have been in the industry for decades.
¬†
We know practitioners and teachers can sometimes be put off by the idea of ‚Äúdoing drama‚Äù because they feel self-conscious. We never make anyone do anything in our training sessions that make them feel embarrassed. Our courses and resources have been developed with the non-drama specialist in mind. We are confident that even if you are naturally reserved, or hated drama at school, you will be able to use our techniques and approaches with confidence and skill. What‚Äôs more, practitioners tell us that once they start working in this way, and see the incredible benefits to children, they don‚Äôt ever want to stop! 
¬†
Our approach to play and our resources have been tried-and-tested countless times by both our directors and our franchisees, and have been enjoyed by literally thousands of children the world over. We know they do what we set out to do: develop life skills in children.

We pride ourselves on offering excellent value for money and outstanding ongoing support. Find out more at https://www.pyjamadrama.com/training-and-resources


More about our franchising opportunity



Established in 2005, Pyjama Drama is a drama and imaginative play programme for babies, toddlers, and children up to seven years old taught in nurseries, schools, in 'public' sessions, and at birthday parties by our incredible team of franchisees and teachers.¬†

Since 2009, we have been supporting individuals who want to run their own children‚Äôs activity business by training them how to run a Pyjama Drama business. We have trained franchisees from all over the world, from all walks of life, and with varying formal drama and teaching experience. The skill of our franchisees is evident in the incredible reviews they regularly receive!

We're not a stage school. Imagination lies at the heart of our programme not performance, and in each session, our franchisees lead children in exciting adventures - singing, dancing, pretending, playing, and exploring magical lands together.¬†

A child's imagination is a powerful tool; it's key to developing the skills they need to lead happy and successful lives outside the home, helping them to make friends, manage conflict, regulate their emotions, develop confidence, build self-esteem, and so much more!

As a Pyjama Drama franchisee, you can play a crucial role in helping to develop these all-important skills in your community, making a demonstrable difference to the children you work with, and creating a robust, financially rewarding business at the same time.

We use Yotpo because it enables our customers to review specific products along with the service received.

Sadly -we cannot pay for both systems and therefore we find, although customers are sometimes kind enough to post TWO reviews - one on our site and one here, most customers tend to only resort to posting on here when they have had a problem which is naturally distressing but unavoidable.

The result is a very unfair representation of how many unhappy customers we actually have.

I (Richard) am fanatical about providing a unique level of service and if anyone ever has a problem I will contact them in person to help resolve their issue.

Richards Guitars provides a bespoke service for anyone requiring a quality acoustic or electric guitar.

Live Help is available throughout the day and night via our website, we have a growing Youtube video library and of course you are welcome to visit in person and chat to me - Richard who has specialised in Guitar retail for 27 years - or one of my lovely team :)

Every guitar sold is set up to perfection in our workshop and play tested before dispatch to ensure your guitar feels like ""your"" guitar on arrival and not just ""a"" guitar.

Through a combination of rapid dynamic therapies (CBT, NLP & Hypnotherapy) and emotional coaching techniques, over no more than three or four sessions most of our clients exceed their own expectations for rapid, genuine, long lasting change. 

We work across a myriad emotional challenges including low self confidence and self esteem, anxiety, phobias, addictions, food and relationship issues and smoking cessation.

We are a small team of two - Kirsten Dahlerup and Steve Burns. Between us we have over 40 years of experience working one to one with over 6,000 clients. 

We work in very (very) different ways using different modalities, so it is rare that we can't help a client change. 

Kirsten for example has a passion for and specialises in healing childhood trauma whilst Steve is more focussed around addictions, phobias and emotional  coaching. 

In this crazy world of ours, living an emotionally healthy life is the key to living a happier life and given we only get one shot, perhaps it's time to consider doing some work on yourself because as John Milton so aptly put it: 

‚ÄòThe mind is its own place - it can make a heaven out of hell or a hell out of heaven.‚Äô"

Events & Entertainment,scottstonebridge.com,"Thank you for visiting my Trustpilot profile, where I am proud to hold a five-star Excellent rating‚Äîa reflection of the trust and appreciation shared by my clients around the world. As a Psychic Clairvoyant Medium, I have dedicated my life to helping others find clarity, peace, and healing through spiritual guidance.

From a young age, I‚Äôve been deeply connected to the Spirit World, guided by an unwavering purpose to support and uplift those in need. My journey has included studying at the prestigious Arthur Findlay College of Spiritualism and Psychic Sciences, the world‚Äôs leading institution for spiritual learning. The knowledge and skills I gained there continue to guide me in delivering readings that are compassionate, insightful, and deeply personal.

Over the years, I‚Äôve had the privilege of connecting with clients globally, offering them a trusted, non-judgemental space to explore their spiritual questions and challenges. Whether bringing through messages from loved ones who have passed or providing guidance during life‚Äôs pivotal moments, my work is rooted in empathy, understanding, and a profound respect for each person‚Äôs unique journey. I take great pride in making spiritual insight accessible and meaningful, empowering my clients with clarity and hope.

In 2020, my life took a significant turn when I was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease (MND). This challenge has strengthened my resolve to make a difference not only spiritually but also through advocacy and support for MND research. My dedication to this cause was recognised in 2024 when I appeared on Ant and Dec‚Äôs Saturday Night Takeaway for my charity work, an experience that further reinforced my commitment to raising awareness and supporting life-saving research.

Every reading I offer is guided by integrity, compassion, and a deep connection to spirit. My clients have described their experiences as transformative, often leaving with a renewed sense of direction, comfort, and empowerment. I am grateful for the trust they place in me, and my five-star Trustpilot rating is a testament to the value of this connection.

If you are considering a reading or seeking spiritual insight, I invite you to explore my services and see how I can help. Your trust means everything to me, and I am honoured to provide the guidance and support you need with care, respect, and the light of spirit."

Events & Entertainment,libidex.com,"Libidex first came onto the scene in 1989 when designer Helen Saffery teamed up with rubber enthusiast & designer Simon Rose.
The designs created by Libidex back then were ground-breaking in the latex world, pre-empting the couture/latex crossover designs of Gaultier, Mugler and McQueen. Helen was the first person to design latex garments actually tailored from the human body. The Libidex fit became famous and it‚Äôs now become the industry standard.


Libidex was one of the first latex fashion companies to go online ‚Äì yes, really! Launching the website brought Libidex latex clothing to an international audience for the first time, and in October 2004 Libidex opened its fetish emporium in Covent Garden, ""Liberation"", which is still today the only latex shop in central London. 


According to Simon, ""Our main selling point is that we offer a high-quality latex clothing at a very reasonable price‚Äù. His philosophy has always been to create designs which appeal to a wide audience, rather than to a ‚Äòrubber elite‚Äô. Libidex customers come from all walks of life and in all shapes and sizes: from mature, experienced rubber aficionados to the gay scene, transsexuals and transvestites, via clubbers looking for something funky to wear or shy first-timers, and even theatre and opera designers. Celebrity clients have included Emma Bunton, Eminem, Oasis, Caprice, Lady Gaga and Julian Clary, and Libidex has worked with fashion houses such as Vivienne Westwood, Dolce and Gabbana, and the late Alexander McQueen. It has even dressed the Opera at La Scala Milan, and a production of Monteverdi's Coronation of Poppaea at English National Opera in London.


Over the years, Libidex has added substantially to its collection, and now offers a very wide range of styles and colours, from classics to more exotic designs like military uniforms or inflatable rubber. Libidex is now one of the largest producers of high quality latex garments in the world!

Our Philosophy
At Daylesford, we‚Äôre dedicated to growing, producing and cooking seasonal, organic food. It must be fresh, and full of flavour, packed with the many vitamins and minerals that come from natural food, picked and eaten at its peak. 
As part of a mission to reverse the industrialisation of our food and the pollution of the land that nurtures it, we practise organic, sustainable framing with far less pesticides and herbicides on our crops. We do not use artificial growth promoters and hormones on our animals, and maintain the highest welfare standards.
Above all, we believe that when people eat natural, organic food, they can taste the difference. It‚Äôs a chain of goodness that begins with healthy soil, and finishes with healthy animals and people.
Our Farmshops
From high-quality larder staples to indulgent treats for special occasions, our farmshop shelves are full with fresh seasonal fruit and vegetables from our organic Market Garden, artisan bread made by hand in our own Bakery, award-winning cheese from our Creamery and fresh organic meat from clover-rich pastures.
Our Homewares collections are made by makers who are as passionate about sustainability, quality materials and elegant design as we are to create one-of-a-kind items for your homes and gardens, from the softest linens to the signature scents of our home fragrance range.
Our Caf√©s
Our organic caf√©s are the natural showcase for what we do on the farm. Here, our chefs make our produce the star of each plate, with seasonally changing menus and daily specials highlight what‚Äôs good to eat right now."

"Food, Beverages & Tobacco",hootingowl.co.uk,"The Hooting Owl Distillery, based within the ancient city walls of York, we take inspiration and flavours from around the Yorkshire region to create a top-quality range of hand-crafted, small batch spirits. The company‚Äôs was founded at Barmby Moor House, once a famous public house and iconic coaching inn, is steeped in history spanning several centuries. Tired horses would be changed here after the gruelling journey from York over ‚ÄòThe Black Moor‚Äô and it‚Äôs reputed that a young Queen Victoria stayed at the house, the master bedroom still being known today as The Queen‚Äôs Room in her honour. Making good use of the extensive old stable building at Barmby Moor House, Hooting Owl is home to a fully equipped craft distillery, expertly distilling a range of traditional dry gins and other premium craft spirits combining a carefully researched and selected blend of botanicals. Inspired by the story of the house itself and by the geography, culinary heritage and abundant produce of Yorkshire, Hooting Owl also adds a hint of family and military history to the mix. The Story of Sir Owlfred The curious, whimsical story of The Hooting Owl Distillery and the legend of Sir Owlfred Tyton Hodgins, is as captivating and mysterious as the history of Barmby Moor House itself. When Dom acquired the old Yorkshire manor house at Barmby Moor in 2017, they embarked on an extensive restoration of the historic property. It was as the couple were refurbishing the old scullery that they stumbled across an intriguing, concealed floor safe which had belonged to a former resident of Barmby Moor House, Sir Owlfred Tyton Hodgins. Hiding within was a single bottle of Sir Owlfred‚Äôs Hooting Owl Signature Gin and an old book containing many of his secret recipes. Tied carefully to the book was a small diary of his development journey which he had titled ‚ÄòA Tour of Yorkshire‚Äô. The diary, embellished with drawings of his distillery, clearly showed it had been located in the stable buildings to the back of the house, buildings which still existed, albeit in a somewhat dilapidated state. This extraordinary discovery began a new, exciting chapter in the Hooting Owl story. Dom, as Sir Owlfred had done before them, set out on a journey which was to draw inspiration from all four corners of Yorkshire to lovingly distil a range of high quality artisan spirits in the very location it was thought to have begun in 1865. Today, the ethos of The Hooting Owl Distillery is heavily influenced by Yorkshire and is intrinsically woven with the story of Sir Olwlfed, the name Hooting Owl deriving from the prominent golden owl statue that takes pride of place above the entrance to the house ‚Äì affectionately addressed as Sir Owlfred Tyton Hodgins."

 Introduction: 
 We have been providing quality fuels to the UK for over 90 years, taking pride in our heritage and expertise in the coal industry. To make our products more accessible, we created an online shop that is simple to use and easy to navigate, with our customers in mind. 
 Our goal is to deliver the best house coal, smokeless fuel, and kiln-dried logs at competitive prices. 
 We have carefully selected our most popular products and brought them to your doorstep in a few simple clicks. Our longevity in the industry can be attributed to our commitment to quality products and excellent customer service. 
 Our History: 
 Since 1932, our family business has been thriving thanks to the late Jack Harrison‚Äôs vision. We are proud to say that our traditional family values have remained at the core of everything we do. Back in the day, we used to deliver coal to local homes using horses and carts. Although times have changed, the memories of those days remain with us, and we still cherish them. As the business grew, Jack‚Äôs son Geoff joined him on trips to the mine. It was on one of these trips that Geoff thought he was left behind and walked all the way to the mine! Such memories remind us of the hard work and dedication that went into building this business. As the years went by, all four of Jack‚Äôs sons joined the business, and we have since expanded our product range to meet the demands of the modern world. 
 Today, we employ a team of around 30 staff who work tirelessly to deliver modern, efficient fuels to homes, factories, hotels, farms, and all kinds of premises. We have harnessed technology to keep up with the needs of the 21st century and supply garage forecourts and shops with pre-packed fuels. We moved to our current location at the industrial estate in Milton in 1992, which allowed us to expand and modernise our business to meet current requirements. We are proud of our history and the legacy that Jack left behind. As we continue to grow and adapt to the ever-changing business landscape, we remain driven by the same values that have kept us going all these years. We are grateful to our loyal customers, and we look forward to serving them for many more years to come. "
